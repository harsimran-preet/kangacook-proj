This project is a web application I developed as part of an assignment to showcase my skills in full-stack development using React.js and Django. The application presents a clean and functional interface built with React on the frontend, while the backend is powered by Django, featuring two API endpoints.

Frontend (React.js)

The frontend is designed using React.js, where I utilized component-based architecture to keep the code modular and easy to manage. The key components of the website include:

	•	Header: Displays the website title and serves as the navigation hub.
	•	Content: This is the core part of the application, where data fetched from the backend is dynamically rendered. It demonstrates how the frontend interacts with the API.
	•	Footer: Provides standard footer information, adding a professional touch to the site.

Backend (Django)

The backend of the application is built with Django and leverages Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create RESTful API endpoints. These endpoints are used by the React frontend to display data in real time. The backend features:

	•	/api/data: An endpoint that returns a list of items stored in the database.
	•	/api/detail/: An endpoint that provides detailed information about a specific item, identified by its ID.

Features

	•	Dynamic Data Interaction: The React frontend fetches and displays data from the Django backend, showcasing real-time updates and interactivity.
	•	Component-Based Structure: Each part of the frontend is broken down into reusable components, making the code clean and scalable.
	•	Efficient API Integration: The backend APIs are efficiently designed to provide data to the frontend, demonstrating seamless communication between the two technologies.

How to Run the Project

	1.	Backend:
	•	Navigate to the Django project directory.
	•	Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	Run the Django server with python manage.py runserver.
	2.	Frontend:
	•	Navigate to the React app directory.
	•	Install the necessary packages with npm install.
	•	Start the development server using npm start.

Conclusion

This web application is a reflection of my ability to develop a complete full-stack application using React.js for the frontend and Django for the backend. The project not only fulfills the task requirements but also serves as a solid foundation for more complex web applications in the future.
